Split-It is a handy web app that automatically calculates the split cost per person, whether paying individually or family-style! Simply upload a picture of your receipt, select your desired options, and split it on the spot!

Family-style: For splitting the bill evenly, per person (like a family meal!)

Individual: For splitting the bill unevenly - perfect for grocery shopping, dinner nights with friends, and even gift shopping!

# Inspiration
Gathering with friends weekly for meals, groceries, or drinks often involves someone picking up the tab. But calculating everyone's share with tax and tip can be more than a hassle - have you ever had to split the grocery bill with roommates? Jeez! But with Split-It, you can say goodbye to those tedious calculations. Just snap a pic of the bill, and let the app do the rest -- You Snap It, We Split It!
